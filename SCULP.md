# Sculpting of Gun Demon
This is a log of scupting process of Gun Demon.

## Steps
1. To automatically generate 3D human faces (better difference expressions, gender, age, race, BMI). About 600.
2. To automatically place heads into the chest of Gun Demon (better with random directions, but facing outwards). Design to place them on several layers of mesh surface.
3. Anthro parts of Gun Demon: jaw (teeth), muscles on shoulder, rib bones.
4. Gun parts of Gun Demon, with varicose veins: 1 as head, several on back, several as arms, 5 ammo belts as tail. Need someone to identify them!
5. Armature: At lease the neck and shoulder should be set as joints. And Flexible bone for tail.
